As you can tell you three main objectives before being able to HV\n\nFirst you will need to upgrade your EBF with two new MV Energy Hatches so it can overcloak and runs HV recipes. That will help you getting stainless steal, the main material for HV and Kanthal that you will use to upgrade your EBF coils.",
