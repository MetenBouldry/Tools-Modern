This path also unlocks &eDiesel&r production for fuel combustion.\\n\\n- &eBiochem route&r: use a &6Pyrolyse Oven&r and wood (a Create-powered tree farm works great). This method gives you more &eBenzene&r and opens the door to using a &eGas Generator&r.\\n\\nEach path has its pros and cons, but eventually, you’ll need both anyway.",

With those, you can craft an &6HV Circuit&r that you'll use to build the &bMV Circuit Assembler&r.\n\nIt's not strictly necessary to do this now—you can continue using the first HV Circuit for progression—but &ait will make your life much easier&r if you take care of it now.

    "quests.medium_voltage.mv_silicon_boule.desc": "&9Silicon Boules&r are made in the &3EBF&r with half a stack of &aSilicon Dust&r and a pinch of &aGallium Arsenide&r. Their primary purpose is engraving &6Circuit Wafers&r.\n\nAfter making the Boule, process it in the &3Cutter&r to get 16 Silicon Wafers ready for engraving.\n\n&cWarning:&r Each Silicon Boule takes &47.5 minutes&r to make at 120 EU/t, or 1,080,000 EU! If the EBF loses power midway, the recipe will start to &close progress&r.\n\nWith that being said, Silicon Boules take an absolute age to craft, so consider parallelizing the recipe in multiple &3EBF&rs and stockpiling them.",

As always, it’s up to you to figure out what’s &abest for your situation&r.",
    "quests.medium_voltage.mv_silicon.desc.2": "First method: &aElectrolyzing Clay Dust&r at &bMV&r. This is one of the best-known techniques. However, it’s a bit harder in &aTFG&r, since we removed the infinite clay trick. That said, you can still find &9large amounts of clay&r, especially in &8The Beneath&r.\n\nSecond method: &amining silicon-rich ores&r. Look for &9Mica&r or &9Kyanite&r veins—they’ll also yield &dAluminum&r. Alternatively, you can &aElectrolyze Zeolite Dust&r, found in &9Chalcopyrite&r and &dRealgar&r veins.\n\nThird method: &eAdvanced but powerful&r. Although more expensive to set up and slower early on, it becomes the &ebest method&r at &6HV&r and beyond. Plus, it generates &9Oxygen&r as a bonus! The idea is simple: &aElectrolyze Silicon Dioxide Dust&r into &9Oxygen&r and &5Silicon&r. You can get &aSilicon Dioxide Dust&r by &9centrifuging Flint Dust&r, which itself comes from &9Flint&r collected by &asifting Gravel&r.\n\nThis setup can become &afully passive&r easily. Try using the &aEMI Recipe Tree&r tool (bottom left of your screen) to plan your builds—it really helps!",
