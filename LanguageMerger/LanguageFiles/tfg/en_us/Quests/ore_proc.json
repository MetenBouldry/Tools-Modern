    "quests.ore_proc.native_ore.subtitle": "Create or Gregtech?",
    "quests.ore_proc.native_ore.desc": "One of the most interesting aspect of &6Gregtech&r is its &dOre Processing Mechanics&r and that's what we are going to guide you through this chapter.\n\nFirst thing first you should learn about the &6Ore Processing Diagram tab in EMI&r. Simply use `U` on any items related to ore processing and look for the &6Iron Ore tab&r. You will get some kind of weird &ddiagram&r that we will help you understand during this chapter.\n\nAlways remember that what we are going to give you here is &4not the perfect and only way&r to do it.\n\nWe trust that would will be able to do your own soup at the end.\n\n&9For veteran GT players or new comer please note that TFG introduce Create into GT Ore Processing, so the choice is yours.&r",

    "quests.ore_proc.ae2.subtitle": "A tag storage bus? What's that",
    "quests.ore_proc.ae2.desc": "If you like spaghetti only with &4tomato sauce&r we got you. With &6AE2&r no more pipes and filters everywhere simply the power of &dTag Storage Bus&r, Interface and &3Subnet&r.\n\nWe sure you know what's an interface but do you know what is the &dTag Storage Bus&r? Basically it's a Storage Bus that exports items by &6tag&r and not specific filter. So if you want a storage bus exporting only your purified ores it's easy just type '&5#forge:purified_ores*&r' or '&5*purified_ores*&r' in it. Obviouly there is other possibilities that we will let you explore. If you want to know the tag of an item, put it in main and type &6/kubejs hand&r\n\nAbout &3subnet&r we won't explain everything here but know atleast this, if you put a &6storage bus&r on an &2interface&r it will seperate the network. The &6storage bus side of the network&r will be able to look into the &2interface side of the newtork&r but &4not the other way around&r. That can be very useful so your ore processing isn't clogging your main storage or to split different processing.",

    "quests.ore_proc.robot_arm.subtitle": "A robot arm sending excatly 4 small dusts filtered by tag?",
    "quests.ore_proc.robot_arm.desc": "As always Gregtech has some pretty crazy tools to help you manage your logistic. You should already know about the &6Robot Arm&r and if you didn't use it yet for your &bVacuum Freezer&r we introduce you to the &6tag filter&r.\n\nIt's a filter for which you don't specify the item but use a tag or a combinaison of tag, you can refer to the explanation in the AE2 quest of this chapter for more.\n\nThe last one we want to introduce is the &4Smart Filter&r, this crazy one is able to filter items depending of a &6recipe&r. If you slap it on a robot arm itself slapped on an electrolyzer and set the robot arm to supply exact. It will supply the exact amount needed for the recipe?",

They do the exact same recipes but as they are multiblock you can chose the &6energy hatches&r and add a &6Parallel Hatch&r so they work faster\n\nAll of them are gated behind the &bAlloy Blast Smelter&r as it's the only multiblock able to create the alloys you need for every casing needed for these multiblocks.

So basically whenever you can use either the &6HV macerator&r or the &6HU crushing wheels&r go for it.\n\nAlso you can see the &dMillstone&r in &bEMI&r but you cannot craft its &6HV&r version so that's why you don't see it here.",

As soon as possible we advise you to use the &bQuern&r to get crushed ores. When you unlock &6Create&r you first machine should be the &bMillstone&r so atleast you can automate it with &bChute&r.\n\nYou don't get any byproduct but it will at least double if not quadruple the amount you would have get.\n\nWe put the &bForge Hammer&r here just so you know you can also use this machine if you need real fast crushing at one point. This one will &4never&r give you byproduct though. Could be useful until you reach &6HV&r.",

To do that you have three options that we will explain in the next quests and give you some example of what we would recommend.\n\nAs always you may have different needs than our propositions so explore &bEMI&r and trust yourself.",
