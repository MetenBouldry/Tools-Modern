This diagram may look overwhelming at first, but we'll take it step by step.\n\nA major part of GregTech philosophy is that there's not just one way to solve a problem, so take everything in this chapter as just a suggestion! We encourage you to customize your ore processing as you see fit.",

You can use the &dTag Storage Bus&r to tell your network where to put items that match an item's tag, which you can view by pressing F3 + H. For example, if you want to send all your Purified Ores to a chest, slap a Tag Storage Bus on it and set its filter to '&5*purified_ores*&r'.\n\nThere's many online guides on how to set up an AE2 system, but a subnet to handle all ore processing before it goes into your main storage is a solid choice!",

The &6Tag Filter&r can filter items by tag, such as '&5*purified_ores*&r' to match all Purified Ores.\n\nThe &4Smart Filter&r can filter items depending on their &6recipe&r. For example, if you use it with a robot arm on an electrolyzer, and set the robot arm to supply exact, it will only move your dusts into the electrolyzer once it has as many inputs as the recipe requires!",
